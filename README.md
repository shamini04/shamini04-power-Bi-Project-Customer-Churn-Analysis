##  Data Modeling & Preparation:
- Used one central Fact Table (Bank Churn Data) and multiple Dimension Tables (Customer Info, Geography, Gender, Credit, etc.).
- Created a custom Calendar Table using DAX to enable time-based analysis.
- Implemented Star Schema with one-to-many relationships between the calendar/dimension tables and the fact table.
- Added a calculated column for Credit Type Classification (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor) based on credit scores.
## Key KPIs:
- Total Customers (distinct count)
- Active Customers
- Inactive Customers
- Credit Card Holders
- Non-Credit Card Holders
- Exit Customers
- Retained Customers
- Each KPI is dynamically calculated and displayed in the report header for quick business insights.

- Bar Chart: Total customers by year segmented by Active and Inactive status.
- Line Chart: Monthly trend of Exit Customers vs Previous Month Customers.
- Donut Chart: Gender-wise distribution of Exit Customers.
- Bar Chart: Exit Customers by Credit Type.
- Pie Chart: Exit Customers by Category (Credit Card Holders vs Non-Holders).
